# Extended Euclidean Algorithm Calculator


- to use
- enter the largest number first
- then, enter the smaller number
- I have not added the checks for largest number or smallest number, so for now, the calculator assumes you will enter the largest number first. The fix for this is a simple check involving comparing both numbers to figure out the largest one, then swapping the numbers.
- It works as intended.
- Gives you the GCD
- Gives you the multiplicative inverse
- Uses Extended Euclidean Algorithm
- the checks for the largest and smallest number have been added to the second version, in this version, you can enter the numbers in any order without worrying about their size
