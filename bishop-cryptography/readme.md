# Bishop Cryptography

Some of the programming concepts in the book are outdated. The mathematical and cryptography concepts are still in use today even though they might not be as secure as 
previously thought. However, all math and cryptography is for educational purposes only. Cryptography is learned using established and "fun" encryption methods even if
they are unsecure.
